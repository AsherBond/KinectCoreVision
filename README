First off all. I´m using last version of openFrameworks witch is quite inestable for the moment. So all this project it could be consider like "very experimental". With some time, patients and collaboration it´s going to work properly.

So let´s get started:

1- Download and install last GitHub openFramework version  
2- Download and put ofxKinect addon inside ...openFramework/addons directory 
3- Donwload KinectCoreVision source code and put it inside one directory under ...openFrameworks/apps folder.
4- Open the xcode project and check that the addons dependences are ok. May be you need to add a search path to: ../../../addons/ofxKinect/libs/libusb/osx/libs under Targets->YourApp->Build->Library Search Paths (make sure All Configurations and All Settings are selected). 

Note: I have to add the search path to opencv/libs/osx/include path to.
